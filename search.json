    "text": "Derrick Tuskan-San Diego State\n\n\nThe Mountain West saw another wild week of basketball as the conference barrels its way towards a record six bids in the NCAA tournament. Seven(!) teams now sit within a game of first place after first-place Utah State fell at Colorado State. Let’s get into it.\n\n Team of the Week: San Diego State\nThings looked grim for the Aztecs at Viejas Arena after the first half of Tuesday’s tilt against Colorado State. The Rams were scorching the nets from distance, Jaedon LeDee spent most of the half on the bench in foul trouble, and SDSU trailed by 14 at the break.\nThen there was the second half.\nThe Aztecs clamped down defensively, holding CSU to three made field goals and a paltry 11 points. LeDee took over the half offensively, scoring 22 points on 8/11 shooting, and the Aztecs rolled to a 71-55 victory.\nSDSU followed that comeback win with a much less dramatic 81-70 home win over New Mexico. LeDee kept Nelly Junior Joseph on the bench all game with foul trouble and proceeded to score 23 points in his absence.\nFor their efforts, the Aztecs got a top four seed in the NCAA selection committee’s bracket preview and a subsequent bump to #19 in the AP poll. Vibes are good on the Mesa.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Nick Davidson\nNick Davidson played solid minutes off the bench for the Nevada Wolf Pack last season, and has started every game so far in 2023-24. Yet somehow, it feels like Nick Davidson is the biggest discovery in northern Nevada since the Comstock Lode. Through January, Davidson’s career high in scoring was 19 points. Since the calendar turned to February, he has averaged 19.8 ppg, along with 8.8 rpg. Davidson’s rise couldn’t have come at a better time for the Wolf Pack; they’re 4-1 in that stretch, with the only loss a home heartbreaker to New Mexico on Tuesday, and they currently find themselves on the right side of NCAA tournament bubble.\n\n\nGame to Watch: San Diego State at Utah State\n\n2/20, 7 PM MT (CBSSN), Logan, UT\nThe red-hot Aztecs hold the tiebreaker for first place in the Mountain West, and they can secure sole possession with a win at Utah State on Tuesday. SDSU is playing some of their best basketball of the season, while Utah State is limping into their bye week, having lost three of five. The Aggies’ offense looked woeful in a Saturday loss at Colorado State, and the Aztec’s top-ranked defense is not exactly the cure for an ailing offense. But SDSU hasn’t won a road game at any of the other top six MW schools, and Logan is arguably the most difficult place to play in the conference. This should be one of the best games of the season."

    "text": "Ryan Levy-Nevada\n\n\nThe Mountain West’s women’s basketball season has seen stability at the top (UNLV) and at the bottom (SJSU, USU), but 2-9 seem to be anyone’s best guess at this point. Let’s highlight some of the key storylines from the week that was in the conference.\n\n Team of the Week: Nevada\nIf you thought coming into conference play that the Nevada Wolf Pack would contend for a first round bye in the Mountain West tournament, you were probably alone in doing so. Nevada was picked 8th out of 11 teams in the preseason poll and went 5-7 against the 311th ranked nonconference schedule in the country, including a loss to NET 277 Weber State. Yet after a Valentine’s week of thrilling wins over San Diego State and Boise State, the Wolf Pack currently hold the 4 seed in the Mountain West. Audrey Roden led the team with 18 ppg last week, including the go-ahead three against the Aztecs and a clutch steal and score late in OT against the Broncos.\nThe road ahead is challenging for Nevada, with a date against UNLV and trips to New Mexico and Colorado State still to come. But if last week is any indication, this Wolf Pack squad isn’t going away any time soon.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Marta Leimane\nFor every coach in the Mountain West, the top name on their Colorado State scouting report is McKenna Hofschild. With so much focus on stopping the do-it-all guard, CSU needs a second player to step up and take advantage of that space. Last week, that player was sophomore guard Marta Leimane. The Latvian product exploded for a career highs in points and rebounds with a 22-10 double-double at UNLV, a tight 67-64 defeat. As an encore, she put up 20 points on 10-15 shooting in a Border War home upset over Wyoming. The Rams sit at 7-7 in conference play, but with Leimane’s emergence they are a lower seed no one will want to face in March.\n\n\nGame to Watch: New Mexico at Wyoming\n\n2/24, 2 PM MT (Mountain West Network), Laramie, WY\nThe Wyoming Cowgirls have lost two straight, but still remain tied for 2nd place. This upcoming week presents their toughest challenge of the season. With all due respect to Wednesday night’s game vs. 1st place UNLV, the Cowgirls’ matchup with 2nd place New Mexico is the more impactful matchup of the weekend. A loss would mean a sweep at the hands of the Lobos and a risk of losing out on a first round bye. A home win over the Rebels would be nice, but defending home court against UNM is vital.\n\n\n\nKevin’s Broadcast Schedule: Colorado State at Utah State\n\n2/24, 2 PM MT (Mountain West Network), Logan, UT\nMcKenna Hofschild and the Colorado State Rams, coming off a Border War win and a midweek bye, come into Logan to take on Cheyenne Stubbs and Utah State. Ajay Salvesen and Kevin Floyd will be on the call from the Spectrum."

    "text": "Utah State Athletics\n\n\nEntering the week, the Mountain West had a highly anticipated slate of mid-week games and a somewhat dull slate of weekend games. Tuesday and Wednesday night lived up to the hype, but Saturday’s competition clearly caught Colorado State and New Mexico off guard. With the Rams slipping and the Lobos taking an ugly resume hit against Air Force, the quest for #SixBidMW stands on the edge of a knife. Let’s get into it!\n\n Team of the Week: Utah State\nFirst place was on the line in Logan last Tuesday as #19 San Diego State visited a slumping Utah State squad. The Spectrum was rocking, Great Osobor found a new gear against conference POY frontrunner Jaedon LeDee, and the Aggies led the whole second half en route to a 68-63 win.\nOn Saturday, USU had a much-needed bye week, where they got to sit at home while conference heavyweights crumbled all around them. Most notably, New Mexico’s loss drops the Lobos two games back of USU in the conference standings, so the Aggies could drop their season finale against UNM and still remain ahead in the standings.\nAs it stands, USU controls the top seed thanks to their tiebreaker over Boise State. Win out and the Aggies can open up the conference tournament against (likely) Wyoming or Fresno State. All that’s left to do is take care of business against the bottom three teams in the league and defend home court against New Mexico.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Darius Brown II\nIt’s not easy for a player to win a conference Player of the Week award while only playing one game that week. Such awards tend to go to players who put together two dominant performances in a given week. In the case of USU’s Darius Brown II, he put together two such performances in one game against San Diego State on Tuesday. Offensively, Brown went off for a game-high 25 points on 8/13 shooting in the Aggies’ big home win. On the defensive end, Brown took on the Aztecs’ Lamont Butler and held the Final Four hero to zero points on five shot attempts.\n\n\nGame to Watch: New Mexico at Boise State\n\n3/2, 6 PM MT (CBSSN), Boise, ID\nNew Mexico suffered a devastating Quad 4 home loss to Air Force on Saturday, and will have a full week to stew over that defeat before going to ExtraMile Arena to take on Boise State. The Broncos have played themselves into a safer NCAA tournament position over the last few weeks, and have their eyes on a Mountain West regular season title. This is a vital game for the Lobos to get safely into the tournament field, and the Broncos can’t afford to drop a game behind Utah State. The calendar says that this is March and the excitement of this game should say the same."

    "text": "UNLV Athletics\n\n\nThe Mountain West women’s basketball regular season title officially goes to the UNLV Lady Rebels! The race for second is heating up, with six teams between 8 and 10 conference wins entering Wednesday’s action. Wyoming lost two marquee home games by a combined four points, and the Cowgirls’ hopes of a 2 seed in Vegas are slipping away with a four game slide. Let’s dive into an exciting week in the MW.\n\n Team of the Week: UNLV\nUNLV has been head and shoulders above the rest of the Mountain West all season, and this week they officially started collecting their well-deserved honors. On Wednesday, the Lady Rebels secured a thrilling 63-60 overtime victory in Laramie against a desperate Wyoming squad, clinching a share of the conference title. On Saturday night, they visited their hated rivals in Reno and handed the Wolf Pack a big little L, winning 98-67 on national TV and claiming their third straight outright regular season title.\nIn four seasons under head coach Lindy La Rocque, the Lady Rebels are an unfathomable 60-9 in conference play, on track to equal Colorado State’s 63-9 record from 2014-17. Desi-Rae Young, averaging 19.0 ppg and 9.6 rpg, has a good chance at winning her second MW Player of the Year award. At 24-2 with a NET ranking of 34 and top 50 wins over Arizona and Oklahoma, CBS Sports has them as an 8 seed, though a loss in the conference tournament could result in a nervy Selection Monday. In a city of flashing lights, UNLV has shone as brightly and steadily as the Luxor.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Tatum Thompson\nA common basketball adage is that “role players play better at home”. Boise State had two tough tests at home last week with New Mexico and Fresno State visiting ExtraMile Arena, and role player Tatum Thompson certainly stepped up to that challenge. The sophomore guard scored 19 points on 9/16 shooting against UNM, leading the Broncos to a 58-55 victory and a season sweep over the Lobos. Thompson followed that up with 11 points and 9 rebounds in a 70-65 win over Fresno State. Boise State now sits in a tie for second place with New Mexico, with trips to UNLV and Colorado State still left on the schedule. The playmaking of Mary Kay Naro and rim protection of Abby Muse tend to grab most of the Boise State related headlines, but it’s the contributions of role players that will set the ceiling for this Broncos squad in March.\n\n\nGame to Watch: San Diego State at New Mexico\n\n2/28, 7 PM MT (Mountain West Network), Albuquerque, NM\nNew Mexico split two nail-biters last week, losing 58-55 at Boise State on Wednesday and surviving 59-58 at Wyoming. They host a rested San Diego State squad looking to secure a first round bye. Should the Lobos win tonight, the path towards the second seed would seemingly open up given the tough schedules ahead for their challengers, Boise State and SDSU. A home win is easier said than done, however; the Aztecs won the first meeting in San Diego 60-53 thanks to a dominant 16-10 performance from Kim Villalobos.\n\n\n\nKevin’s Broadcast Schedule: None :(\nUtah State’s final home game of the season will be next Tuesday, March 5th."
