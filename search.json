    "text": "Derrick Tuskan-San Diego State\n\n\nThe Mountain West saw another wild week of basketball as the conference barrels its way towards a record six bids in the NCAA tournament. Seven(!) teams now sit within a game of first place after first-place Utah State fell at Colorado State. Let’s get into it.\n\n Team of the Week: San Diego State\nThings looked grim for the Aztecs at Viejas Arena after the first half of Tuesday’s tilt against Colorado State. The Rams were scorching the nets from distance, Jaedon LeDee spent most of the half on the bench in foul trouble, and SDSU trailed by 14 at the break.\nThen there was the second half.\nThe Aztecs clamped down defensively, holding CSU to three made field goals and a paltry 11 points. LeDee took over the half offensively, scoring 22 points on 8/11 shooting, and the Aztecs rolled to a 71-55 victory.\nSDSU followed that comeback win with a much less dramatic 81-70 home win over New Mexico. LeDee kept Nelly Junior Joseph on the bench all game with foul trouble and proceeded to score 23 points in his absence.\nFor their efforts, the Aztecs got a top four seed in the NCAA selection committee’s bracket preview and a subsequent bump to #19 in the AP poll. Vibes are good on the Mesa.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Nick Davidson\nNick Davidson played solid minutes off the bench for the Nevada Wolf Pack last season, and has started every game so far in 2023-24. Yet somehow, it feels like Nick Davidson is the biggest discovery in northern Nevada since the Comstock Lode. Through January, Davidson’s career high in scoring was 19 points. Since the calendar turned to February, he has averaged 19.8 ppg, along with 8.8 rpg. Davidson’s rise couldn’t have come at a better time for the Wolf Pack; they’re 4-1 in that stretch, with the only loss a home heartbreaker to New Mexico on Tuesday, and they currently find themselves on the right side of NCAA tournament bubble.\n\n\nGame to Watch: San Diego State at Utah State\n\n2/20, 7 PM MT (CBSSN), Logan, UT\nThe red-hot Aztecs hold the tiebreaker for first place in the Mountain West, and they can secure sole possession with a win at Utah State on Tuesday. SDSU is playing some of their best basketball of the season, while Utah State is limping into their bye week, having lost three of five. The Aggies’ offense looked woeful in a Saturday loss at Colorado State, and the Aztec’s top-ranked defense is not exactly the cure for an ailing offense. But SDSU hasn’t won a road game at any of the other top six MW schools, and Logan is arguably the most difficult place to play in the conference. This should be one of the best games of the season."

    "text": "Ryan Levy-Nevada\n\n\nThe Mountain West’s women’s basketball season has seen stability at the top (UNLV) and at the bottom (SJSU, USU), but 2-9 seem to be anyone’s best guess at this point. Let’s highlight some of the key storylines from the week that was in the conference.\n\n Team of the Week: Nevada\nIf you thought coming into conference play that the Nevada Wolf Pack would contend for a first round bye in the Mountain West tournament, you were probably alone in doing so. Nevada was picked 8th out of 11 teams in the preseason poll and went 5-7 against the 311th ranked nonconference schedule in the country, including a loss to NET 277 Weber State. Yet after a Valentine’s week of thrilling wins over San Diego State and Boise State, the Wolf Pack currently hold the 4 seed in the Mountain West. Audrey Roden led the team with 18 ppg last week, including the go-ahead three against the Aztecs and a clutch steal and score late in OT against the Broncos.\nThe road ahead is challenging for Nevada, with a date against UNLV and trips to New Mexico and Colorado State still to come. But if last week is any indication, this Wolf Pack squad isn’t going away any time soon.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Marta Leimane\nFor every coach in the Mountain West, the top name on their Colorado State scouting report is McKenna Hofschild. With so much focus on stopping the do-it-all guard, CSU needs a second player to step up and take advantage of that space. Last week, that player was sophomore guard Marta Leimane. The Latvian product exploded for a career highs in points and rebounds with a 22-10 double-double at UNLV, a tight 67-64 defeat. As an encore, she put up 20 points on 10-15 shooting in a Border War home upset over Wyoming. The Rams sit at 7-7 in conference play, but with Leimane’s emergence they are a lower seed no one will want to face in March.\n\n\nGame to Watch: New Mexico at Wyoming\n\n2/24, 2 PM MT (Mountain West Network), Laramie, WY\nThe Wyoming Cowgirls have lost two straight, but still remain tied for 2nd place. This upcoming week presents their toughest challenge of the season. With all due respect to Wednesday night’s game vs. 1st place UNLV, the Cowgirls’ matchup with 2nd place New Mexico is the more impactful matchup of the weekend. A loss would mean a sweep at the hands of the Lobos and a risk of losing out on a first round bye. A home win over the Rebels would be nice, but defending home court against UNM is vital.\n\n\n\nKevin’s Broadcast Schedule: Colorado State at Utah State\n\n2/24, 2 PM MT (Mountain West Network), Logan, UT\nMcKenna Hofschild and the Colorado State Rams, coming off a Border War win and a midweek bye, come into Logan to take on Cheyenne Stubbs and Utah State. Ajay Salvesen and Kevin Floyd will be on the call from the Spectrum."

    "text": "Utah State Athletics\n\n\nEntering the week, the Mountain West had a highly anticipated slate of mid-week games and a somewhat dull slate of weekend games. Tuesday and Wednesday night lived up to the hype, but Saturday’s competition clearly caught Colorado State and New Mexico off guard. With the Rams slipping and the Lobos taking an ugly resume hit against Air Force, the quest for #SixBidMW stands on the edge of a knife. Let’s get into it!\n\n Team of the Week: Utah State\nFirst place was on the line in Logan last Tuesday as #19 San Diego State visited a slumping Utah State squad. The Spectrum was rocking, Great Osobor found a new gear against conference POY frontrunner Jaedon LeDee, and the Aggies led the whole second half en route to a 68-63 win.\nOn Saturday, USU had a much-needed bye week, where they got to sit at home while conference heavyweights crumbled all around them. Most notably, New Mexico’s loss drops the Lobos two games back of USU in the conference standings, so the Aggies could drop their season finale against UNM and still remain ahead in the standings.\nAs it stands, USU controls the top seed thanks to their tiebreaker over Boise State. Win out and the Aggies can open up the conference tournament against (likely) Wyoming or Fresno State. All that’s left to do is take care of business against the bottom three teams in the league and defend home court against New Mexico.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Darius Brown II\nIt’s not easy for a player to win a conference Player of the Week award while only playing one game that week. Such awards tend to go to players who put together two dominant performances in a given week. In the case of USU’s Darius Brown II, he put together two such performances in one game against San Diego State on Tuesday. Offensively, Brown went off for a game-high 25 points on 8/13 shooting in the Aggies’ big home win. On the defensive end, Brown took on the Aztecs’ Lamont Butler and held the Final Four hero to zero points on five shot attempts.\n\n\nGame to Watch: New Mexico at Boise State\n\n3/2, 6 PM MT (CBSSN), Boise, ID\nNew Mexico suffered a devastating Quad 4 home loss to Air Force on Saturday, and will have a full week to stew over that defeat before going to ExtraMile Arena to take on Boise State. The Broncos have played themselves into a safer NCAA tournament position over the last few weeks, and have their eyes on a Mountain West regular season title. This is a vital game for the Lobos to get safely into the tournament field, and the Broncos can’t afford to drop a game behind Utah State. The calendar says that this is March and the excitement of this game should say the same."

    "text": "UNLV Athletics\n\n\nThe Mountain West women’s basketball regular season title officially goes to the UNLV Lady Rebels! The race for second is heating up, with six teams between 8 and 10 conference wins entering Wednesday’s action. Wyoming lost two marquee home games by a combined four points, and the Cowgirls’ hopes of a 2 seed in Vegas are slipping away with a four game slide. Let’s dive into an exciting week in the MW.\n\n Team of the Week: UNLV\nUNLV has been head and shoulders above the rest of the Mountain West all season, and this week they officially started collecting their well-deserved honors. On Wednesday, the Lady Rebels secured a thrilling 63-60 overtime victory in Laramie against a desperate Wyoming squad, clinching a share of the conference title. On Saturday night, they visited their hated rivals in Reno and handed the Wolf Pack a big little L, winning 98-67 on national TV and claiming their third straight outright regular season title.\nIn four seasons under head coach Lindy La Rocque, the Lady Rebels are an unfathomable 60-9 in conference play, on track to equal Colorado State’s 63-9 record from 2014-17. Desi-Rae Young, averaging 19.0 ppg and 9.6 rpg, has a good chance at winning her second MW Player of the Year award. At 24-2 with a NET ranking of 34 and top 50 wins over Arizona and Oklahoma, CBS Sports has them as an 8 seed, though a loss in the conference tournament could result in a nervy Selection Monday. In a city of flashing lights, UNLV has shone as brightly and steadily as the Luxor.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Tatum Thompson\nA common basketball adage is that “role players play better at home”. Boise State had two tough tests at home last week with New Mexico and Fresno State visiting ExtraMile Arena, and role player Tatum Thompson certainly stepped up to that challenge. The sophomore guard scored 19 points on 9/16 shooting against UNM, leading the Broncos to a 58-55 victory and a season sweep over the Lobos. Thompson followed that up with 11 points and 9 rebounds in a 70-65 win over Fresno State. Boise State now sits in a tie for second place with New Mexico, with trips to UNLV and Colorado State still left on the schedule. The playmaking of Mary Kay Naro and rim protection of Abby Muse tend to grab most of the Boise State related headlines, but it’s the contributions of role players that will set the ceiling for this Broncos squad in March.\n\n\nGame to Watch: San Diego State at New Mexico\n\n2/28, 7 PM MT (Mountain West Network), Albuquerque, NM\nNew Mexico split two nail-biters last week, losing 58-55 at Boise State on Wednesday and surviving 59-58 at Wyoming. They host a rested San Diego State squad looking to secure a first round bye. Should the Lobos win tonight, the path towards the second seed would seemingly open up given the tough schedules ahead for their challengers, Boise State and SDSU. A home win is easier said than done, however; the Aztecs won the first meeting in San Diego 60-53 thanks to a dominant 16-10 performance from Kim Villalobos.\n\n\n\nKevin’s Broadcast Schedule: None :(\nUtah State’s final home game of the season will be next Tuesday, March 5th."

    "text": "Tyler McFarland - Boise State Athletics\n\n\nThe Mountain West’s Wednesday slate of games generally as expected, though with some tight finishes in Fort Collins, Albuquerque, and Vegas. Saturday, on the other hand? Whackadoodle, bonkers, nonsensical, and outrageous. Let’s dive into a bizarre week of results.\n\n Team of the Week: Air Force\nThrough the first 16 games of conference play, Air Force performed as most Chris Gobrecht-led teams have performed: tough, physical, disciplined, and relentless. Against Utah State on Wednesday, the Falcons turned into an indomitable force of nature en route to an 85-46 Senior Day win, their largest ever in Mountain West play. They suffocated the Aggies defensively, forcing 19 turnovers and holding them to 25% shooting, and blitzed them from long range to the tune of 12/28 from three.\nOn Saturday, Air Force went to Boise and nearly ran the Broncos out of the gym through three quarters, leading 59-43. “Nearly”, however, as the Falcons did another uncharacteristic thing in the fourth quarter: squander the massive lead they had built over the first 30 minutes. Late heroics from Milahnie Perry and an errant final attempt from Boise State saved the day for the Academy, upsetting BSU 67-66.\nThis week didn’t do anything to change the Falcons’ postseason prospects; they remain locked into the 8-9 game after finishing the season with an 8-10 conference record. (The result of New Mexico-Fresno State on Tuesday will only affect jersey colors for their first round matchup.) With this recent flurry and a full week to rest before facing the Bulldogs on Sunday morning, Air Force could cause some chaos in the Mountain West Tournament.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Allyson Fertig\nThe Wyoming Cowgirls entered the week on a four-game losing streak that plummeted them from 2nd place with an outside shot at a conference title to 4th place with a risk of losing a first round bye entirely. Junior center Allyson Fertig made sure that slump wouldn’t extend any further, putting up a hyper-efficient 13-10 double double in a win at San José State on Wednesday and added a monster 24-10 performance in a home win over Fresno State. In a week where New Mexico, Boise State (2x), Colorado State, and Nevada all stumbled, simply circling the wagons and taking right against two lower-tier teams is a significant accomplishment. Fertig has the Cowgirls back in a tie for 2nd place and potentially reestablished as a threat to UNLV in the Mountain West Tournament.\n\n\nGame to Watch: Boise State at Colorado State\n\n3/5, 6:30 PM MT (Mountain West Network), Fort Collins, CO\nJust one round of games remains in the Mountain West regular season, but pretty much nothing is settled apart from UNLV as the top seed. This matchup in Fort Collins is perhaps the most variable of all the games on the MW slate. Boise State could finish anywhere from a 2 seed to a 6 seed depending on other results, while the Rams could end up anywhere from the 4 seed to the 7 seed. This will be the first and only meeting between two of the most electric point guards in the conference, BSU’s Mary Kay Naro and CSU’s McKenna Hofschild. Both teams are desperate for a win and a first round bye in Vegas. And if recent results in the conference are any indication, expect chaos in Fort Collins.\n\n\n\nProjected Conference Standings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData through games of Fri, Mar 08.\nThere’s clarity at the very top and very bottom of the MW standings. Everywhere else is anybody’s best guess even at this late stage in the season. Here’s where each team stands going into the last round of games, with seed probabilities as determined by our Net Ratings through Sunday, 3/3.\n\n UNLV\nUNLV (16-1) has clinched the 1 seed regardless of Tuesday’s result at Utah State.\n\n\n New Mexico\nNew Mexico (11-6) is in the driver’s seat among the first pack of teams despite last Saturday’s home loss to Nevada, having swept Wyoming.\n2 seed: 63.8%\n3 seed: 28.3%\n4 seed: 7.9%\n\n\n Wyoming\nWyoming (11-6) was swept by UNM and split with Boise State in the regular season.

    "text": "Tyler McFarland - Boise State Athletics\n\n\nThe months-long grind of the Mountain West’s regular season is coming to a close this week. For many of the conference’s top teams, this couldn’t come at a better time. Top teams like San Diego State, Utah State, and Nevada are struggling at times to put away the likes of San José State, Air Force, and Fresno State. New Mexico had an opportunity to shore up its tournament chances with a Q1 game at Boise State, but couldn’t get by the Broncos. Let’s dive in.\n\n Team of the Week: Boise State\nAs mentioned at the top, many of the MW’s top teams are struggling to get to the finish line. Boise State is the clear exception to this rule. In February, the Broncos played five games against bottom-four teams and won by 38, 24, 32, 20, and 29 at an Air Force team on Tuesday that had just won in the Pit. Taking care of business like this has lofted Boise State from being the bubbliest MW team in January to being very securely in the tournament field as we enter March.\nOh, and the Broncos hosted a desperate and rested New Mexico team in Boise on Saturday and came away with a cool ten point win, fueled by a 24-13 performance from O’Mar Stanley. Ho-hum, another day at the office for Leon Rice and company.\nBoise State still remains in a tie for first place with Utah State, though they don’t hold the tiebreaker, and they finish with a tough pair of games at home against Nevada and at San Diego State. The Broncos may not get the #1 seed they desire, but at this point they’re playing more like a #1 seed than anyone else in the Mountain West.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Jarod Lucas\nJarod Lucas has earned a reputation as being one of the best shooters in the Mountain West. He’s third in the conference in three-pointers made while shooting them at a 41% clip. He leads the conference in free throw percentage (despite a notable cold spell) at a hair over 90%. On Tuesday night, he took the metaphorical descriptor “in-the-gym range” a bit more literally, sinking a half-court, banked-in buzzer beater to stun Colorado State in Moby Arena. That miracle was part of a 23 point, 7 rebound performance and followed an unthinkable (for Lucas) stretch of three missed free throws in the final minute.\nOn Friday night in Reno, Nevada got everything from a suddenly feisty Fresno State team, but Lucas again came through with 21 points (and zero missed clutch FTs) to stave off the upset bid.\nNevada is just a game behind Utah State and Boise State for the conference lead, and travels to Boise along with hosting UNLV this week. With a strong finish and some help from New Mexico, Nevada has a chance at a regular season title and even a top seed in Vegas.\n\n\nGame to Watch: New Mexico at Utah State\n\n3/9, 6:30 PM MT (CBSSN), Logan, UT\nNew Mexico couldn’t secure a much needed Quad 1 win on Saturday in Boise, but has another opportunity to feel a little more secure about their NCAA tournament chances with a Quad 1 road opportunity at Utah State. The Aggies have lost just once at home all season, but following a week where they barely survived Fresno State and struggled to put away Air Force at home, the conference leaders look a bit vulnerable right now.\nFor New Mexico, win and the Lobos should be safely in the field (barring disaster in Vegas or at home Wednesday against the Bulldogs). Lose, and UNM might need a run in Pit West to get back to the NCAA tournament for the first time in a decade. For Utah State, a win secures a regular season title and a #1 seed in Vegas (barring a defeat Wednesday at SJSU). The Aggies have plenty to play for of their own on Senior Night in Logan."

    "text": "UNLV Athletics\n\n\nThe Mountain West tournament is finally here! The tournament starts with three first round games on Sunday, followed by quarterfinal action on Monday, the semifinals on Tuesday, and the final on Wednesday night. Here’s what to look for over the next four days in Las Vegas.\n\nConference Tournament Projection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecast data as of Sat, Mar 09.\n\n Favorite: UNLV\nThe UNLV Lady Rebels, ranked #23 in the country and fresh off 59 and 60 point victories in their last two conference games, are the overwhelming favorite to win the Mountain West Tournament. For perspective, the only teams with greater chances of winning their tournament according to our Conference Tournament Projections are #1 South Carolina (has lost one game in the last two years), #15 Gonzaga (undefeated in the WCC with a highly favorable tournament format), and Florida Gulf Coast (has the all-time highest winning percentage in college basketball).\nThe Lady Rebels have the league’s best player (Desi-Rae Young), three-point shooter (Alyssa Durazo-Frescas, 45.3%), another top-three rebounder (Alyssa Brown), and three players in the top ten in Player Efficiency Rating (Young, Amarachi Kimpson, Nneka Obiazor). At 17-1 in conference play, they have the third best Mountain West record since realignment, behind only the 2015-15 CSU Rams and last year’s Lady Rebels. The sheer amount of talent on Lindy La Rocque’s squad is unmatched. Few teams have hung with UNLV for a whole game, and only one has managed to win…\n\n\n Challenger: New Mexico\nThe second-seeded New Mexico Lobos come into the tournament with two advantages over the rest of the Mountain West field: a comparatively easy route to the final, and a win in Las Vegas over UNLV. On January 20th, the Lobos went into the Cox Pavilion and stunned the then-#25 Lady Rebels 69-66. UNM played a pretty clean game, shooting 42% from the field and 47% from distance while committing just 11 turnovers. Viane Cumber led the Lobos with 22 points (including 6 threes!) and 7 rebounds, while Aniya Augmon added 15 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists. New Mexico is going to need stellar performances again from those two, plus leading scorer Nyah Wilson (15.3 ppg) if they want to pull off another shocker in Vegas.\n\n\n Darkhorse: Colorado State\nThe fifth-seeded Colorado State Rams feel like the ultimate RollerCoaster Tycoon ride: high Excitement from the stellar play of reigning Player of the Year McKenna Hofschild, very high Intensity in close losses to UNLV (2x), SDSU, and Wyoming as well as thrilling wins over New Mexico and Wyoming, and moderate Nausea from ugly road losses at Nevada, Air Force, and SJSU. By our Net Ratings, CSU is the second best team in the conference. By vibes, they can be anywhere from the second best to the second worst team in the conference depending on the day. They face off against a Nevada team in the quarterfinals that is eighth in Net Rating and has both won at New Mexico and lost at home to Utah State. Could CSU knock off UNLV and reach the Diamond Heights of the NCAA tournament? Or could they fall flat against Nevada and render this season a Fiasco Forest?\n\n\n\nProjected NCAA Tournament Seeds\nHere’s where the Lady Rebels project into the NCAA tournament, per CBS Sports.\n\n\n\nTeam\nProjection\n\n\n\n\nUNLV\n8 seed\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin’s Broadcast Schedule: Utah State vs. Boise State\n\n3/9, 7 PM PT (Varsity app, 107.7 FM in Cache Valley), Las Vegas, NV\nEleventh seed Utah State will face the sixth seed Boise State Broncos in the final game of Sunday’s first round action. Ajay Salvesen and Kevin Floyd will be on the call from the Thomas & Mack Center on the Utah State Radio Network, while the video feed can be found at the Mountain West Network."

    "text": "Kevin Floyd\n\n\nThe Mountain West regular season finished with a flourish as Utah State came from behind to beat New Mexico and take the outright conference title. Now comes perhaps the most highly anticipated Mountain West tournament in the conference’s quarter century history, starting with the first round on Wednesday. Here’s what to look for over the next four days at the Thomas & Mack.\n\nProjected Conference Standings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecast data as of Wed, Mar 13.\n\n Favorite: San Diego State\nThe San Diego State Aztecs are a step behind last year’s team that won the Mountain West tournament and springboarded themselves to the national championship game. The defense is very good (16th best in Def Rtg) but not the elite unit of previous years, and their offense when Jaedon LeDee isn’t on the floor is as stagnant as rush hour traffic on I-5. It’s no wonder that the Aztecs have struggled to win away from home and fell all the way to the five seed following a home loss to Boise State in the season finale.\nYet, I can’t think of any other team better built to win three games in three days than SDSU. The bench depth, while less formidable than the nine-deep roster of a year ago, is still a step above their conference foes. Aztec fans travel to Vegas in greater numbers than about any other fan base in the conference (with the possible exception of New Mexico). And in a setting where shooting percentages tend to dip (especially in the final), there’s no team better suited to win a rock fight.\n\n\n Challenger: Utah State\nThe top-seeded Utah State Aggies are the #1 seed for the first time in their ten years in the Mountain West. Apart from the very fun and cool things like cutting down nets, winning awards, and quote tweeting the MW preseason rankings, this also means that they have a chance to reach their first-ever early semifinal. The difference between a 17 hour turnaround versus 14 hours can mean the difference between getting a full night’s rest and a morning shootaround and having to choose between the two. USU will face the winner of Wyoming-Fresno State in the first round, which is noteworthy because neither of those teams is a part of the Mountain West’s heptagon of destruction. They have the easiest road of any team in their quest to sweep the Mountain West titles.\n\n\n Darkhorse: New Mexico\nThe sixth-seeded New Mexico Lobos are watching their NCAA tournament hopes slip away. A shocking home loss to Air Force sent the Lobos reeling, falling out of a first round bye entirely. Despite passing the eye test, their thin tournament resume means New Mexico is going to need to pick up a big win or two in Vegas to get themselves back into the field. UNM is dangerous under any circumstances, but with their backs against the wall plus an expected strong showing from their rabid fanbase, the Lobos seem downright terrifying.\n\n\n\nProjected NCAA Tournament Seeds\nHere’s where the top schools project into the NCAA tournament, per UState Bracketology.\n\n\n\nTeam\nProjection\n\n\n\n\nUtah State\n5 seed\n\n\nNevada\n5 seed\n\n\nSan Diego State\n6 seed\n\n\nBoise State\n8 seed\n\n\nColorado State\n9 seed\n\n\nNew Mexico\n11 seed, Last Four In\n\n\nUNLV\nWin MW Tournament"
