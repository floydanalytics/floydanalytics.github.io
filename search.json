    "text": "Derrick Tuskan-San Diego State\n\n\nThe Mountain West saw another wild week of basketball as the conference barrels its way towards a record six bids in the NCAA tournament. Seven(!) teams now sit within a game of first place after first-place Utah State fell at Colorado State. Let’s get into it.\n\n Team of the Week: San Diego State\nThings looked grim for the Aztecs at Viejas Arena after the first half of Tuesday’s tilt against Colorado State. The Rams were scorching the nets from distance, Jaedon LeDee spent most of the half on the bench in foul trouble, and SDSU trailed by 14 at the break.\nThen there was the second half.\nThe Aztecs clamped down defensively, holding CSU to three made field goals and a paltry 11 points. LeDee took over the half offensively, scoring 22 points on 8/11 shooting, and the Aztecs rolled to a 71-55 victory.\nSDSU followed that comeback win with a much less dramatic 81-70 home win over New Mexico. LeDee kept Nelly Junior Joseph on the bench all game with foul trouble and proceeded to score 23 points in his absence.\nFor their efforts, the Aztecs got a top four seed in the NCAA selection committee’s bracket preview and a subsequent bump to #19 in the AP poll. Vibes are good on the Mesa.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Nick Davidson\nNick Davidson played solid minutes off the bench for the Nevada Wolf Pack last season, and has started every game so far in 2023-24. Yet somehow, it feels like Nick Davidson is the biggest discovery in northern Nevada since the Comstock Lode. Through January, Davidson’s career high in scoring was 19 points. Since the calendar turned to February, he has averaged 19.8 ppg, along with 8.8 rpg. Davidson’s rise couldn’t have come at a better time for the Wolf Pack; they’re 4-1 in that stretch, with the only loss a home heartbreaker to New Mexico on Tuesday, and they currently find themselves on the right side of NCAA tournament bubble.\n\n\nGame to Watch: San Diego State at Utah State\n\n2/20, 7 PM MT (CBSSN), Logan, UT\nThe red-hot Aztecs hold the tiebreaker for first place in the Mountain West, and they can secure sole possession with a win at Utah State on Tuesday. SDSU is playing some of their best basketball of the season, while Utah State is limping into their bye week, having lost three of five. The Aggies’ offense looked woeful in a Saturday loss at Colorado State, and the Aztec’s top-ranked defense is not exactly the cure for an ailing offense. But SDSU hasn’t won a road game at any of the other top six MW schools, and Logan is arguably the most difficult place to play in the conference. This should be one of the best games of the season."

    "text": "Ryan Levy-Nevada\n\n\nThe Mountain West’s women’s basketball season has seen stability at the top (UNLV) and at the bottom (SJSU, USU), but 2-9 seem to be anyone’s best guess at this point. Let’s highlight some of the key storylines from the week that was in the conference.\n\n Team of the Week: Nevada\nIf you thought coming into conference play that the Nevada Wolf Pack would contend for a first round bye in the Mountain West tournament, you were probably alone in doing so. Nevada was picked 8th out of 11 teams in the preseason poll and went 5-7 against the 311th ranked nonconference schedule in the country, including a loss to NET 277 Weber State. Yet after a Valentine’s week of thrilling wins over San Diego State and Boise State, the Wolf Pack currently hold the 4 seed in the Mountain West. Audrey Roden led the team with 18 ppg last week, including the go-ahead three against the Aztecs and a clutch steal and score late in OT against the Broncos.\nThe road ahead is challenging for Nevada, with a date against UNLV and trips to New Mexico and Colorado State still to come. But if last week is any indication, this Wolf Pack squad isn’t going away any time soon.\n\n\n Player of the Week: Marta Leimane\nFor every coach in the Mountain West, the top name on their Colorado State scouting report is McKenna Hofschild. With so much focus on stopping the do-it-all guard, CSU needs a second player to step up and take advantage of that space. Last week, that player was sophomore guard Marta Leimane. The Latvian product exploded for a career highs in points and rebounds with a 22-10 double-double at UNLV, a tight 67-64 defeat. As an encore, she put up 20 points on 10-15 shooting in a Border War home upset over Wyoming. The Rams sit at 7-7 in conference play, but with Leimane’s emergence they are a lower seed no one will want to face in March.\n\n\nGame to Watch: New Mexico at Wyoming\n\n2/24, 2 PM MT (Mountain West Network), Laramie, WY\nThe Wyoming Cowgirls have lost two straight, but still remain tied for 2nd place. This upcoming week presents their toughest challenge of the season. With all due respect to Wednesday night’s game vs. 1st place UNLV, the Cowgirls’ matchup with 2nd place New Mexico is the more impactful matchup of the weekend. A loss would mean a sweep at the hands of the Lobos and a risk of losing out on a first round bye. A home win over the Rebels would be nice, but defending home court against UNM is vital.\n\n\n\nKevin’s Broadcast Schedule: Colorado State at Utah State\n\n2/24, 2 PM MT (Mountain West Network), Logan, UT\nMcKenna Hofschild and the Colorado State Rams, coming off a Border War win and a midweek bye, come into Logan to take on Cheyenne Stubbs and Utah State. Ajay Salvesen and Kevin Floyd will be on the call from the Spectrum."
